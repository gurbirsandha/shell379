Notes:
    The "jobs" command displays process status using "R" for running and "S" for suspended.
    Running the "exit" command will wait for all running processes to finish executing and will kill all suspended processes before exiting the shell.

Running instructions:
    Running make will generate an executable called shell379, which will run the shell program. The makefile contains other targets that I used for testing purposes. Please ignore those. In the terminal in the project directory, please run:

        make
        ./shell379

Acknowledgements:
    The following answer helped me solve a stdout redirection problem when writing the output of the "jobs" and "exit" commands to a user-specified file:

    I used the code from the following post to implement my SIGCHLD signal handler function:

    Other than the above, I used Linux man pages and the eClass discussion forum to understand other system calls and get other tips.
